We also have our own private deck with a gorgeous view of the Golden Gate bridge - amazing for BBQs and fleet week. The room fits a queen bed and has a built-in desk area and closet, and will fit a dresser or chair. The apartment has plenty of storage. There is a large dining room and open floor plan to the living room. The bathroom is only shared with 1 other.\nWe're in an amazing location that has great restaurants down the street (Abrazo's, Swensen's Ice Cream, Ssal, Seven Hills), close to Polk street (far enough to avoid the noise), and walking distance to North Beach, Marina, Nob Hill etc. If you work downtown or the financial district, the bus stop is right behind us on Union street.\nThe room will be available beginning October 1st.\nThe roommates are male and in their late 20s and 30s. We enjoy going out, but mainly keep it low-key on the weekdays. It's a spacious apartment and we have plenty of shared space in the apartment as well. Send us a message to check it out in person.",

I'm 31, work in mental health tech at a series C startup - mostly from home right now but we have a new office opening up soon.\nI'm looking for a quiet, clean, and comfortable place to live. I have been in my current house for about 7 years, and can provide a letter of reference from my landlord if needed.\nIdeally need a garage or gated side yard to park a motorcycle. \nI'm mature, respectful, mellow, extremely clean, communicative, and quiet. In my free time, I enjoy going to the park, getting some food, grabbing a beer and watching a game. I am an amateur film photographer, and am out of the house as much as possible.\nI like to make some food and watch a show or movie in the weekday evenings - would love to live with someone(s) who wants to hang out, but also don’t not need to be best friends.\nOn weekends, I am typically out of the house for most of the day and night. Not a big partier at all, and DEFINITELY don't bring the party back home.\nI have a super friendly, medium sized dog named Oliver, who is about 10 years old. He is 100% trained, fully house broken, loves his crate, and is with me most of the time anyways. He loves to cuddle on the couch (if you want him to) - he's a big lap dog and doesn't realize that he's not a little guy. Also, he is a certified and trained emotional support and therapy dog, and has all his paperwork if the landlord needs to see it.",

The house is quiet most of the time but we do like to occasionally host movie nights, game nights, parties, and dinners. \nAmenities:\nThe room comes furnished with everything you see in the pictures. You will be using the upstairs bathroom but the downstairs one is available in case of emergencies. There is a in-unit washer and dryer. The kitchen has a dishwasher and is fully-stocked with most things you will need for cooking. Our street always has parking spots available and it doesn't have street cleaning so you never have to move your car! We have cleaners who come every 2 weeks to clean the common areas!",

The rent would be $1,550 ($4750/month total) with utilities totaling about $125/month. The security deposit is $2375. The lease is currently month to month, but we’d like for someone to be here for a longer term. Move in date would be Nov. 1, but could accommodate a few days earlier! Unfortunately, pets are not allowed. \nFeatures:\nStainless Steel Appliances\nDish Washer\nIn unit washer + dryer\nCentral \nDouble paned windows\nHard floors/tile in common areas\n10 foot ceilings\nGreat views!

Currently working in the office TWR and at home on Mondays and Fridays. I'm from Nashville, Tennessee and have lived in San Francisco for the last 4 years. Before moving to SF, I lived in Santa Barbara for undergrad. Some of my interests include: public policy, urbanism, politics, fashion/styling, drag culture, video games, green spaces, parks, and museums. In my spare time, I'm usually hanging out with friends or my partner, going to the park, engaging in nightlife activities and other things going on in the city. \nO (25, M?): I work as a public sector consultant helping state governments implement health and human services projects. I work from home unless I am traveling which tends to happen a few times a quarter. I grew up in rural Colorado before going to college in rural New Hampshire, and I have been in San Francisco for 2 years. When I’m not trapped at my desk, I try to live an active life of running, swimming, skiing, hiking, biking, and any other activities my friends want to drag me to. I don’t drink, but love a good night out dancing. I also have a passion for languages and am a lifelong learner of Spanish, French, and Arabic. \nIf this sounds like a good fit, feel free to send me a message with a little bit about you and we’ll reach out!",

We have a balcony overlooking Chrissy Field and it’s about a 5 min walk down to the water! There’s a rock gym down the hill (Movement) and sea lions at the pier. The rent is around $1600 a month including utilities (which won’t be charged for the first 3 months). We will be renegotiating the lease in November with the new roommate, but we don’t anticipate the rent increasing too much. It’s a 3 bedroom apartment, with 1 full bathroom and 1 half bathroom downstairs. Washer and dryer included, wifi, and a fully furnished living room. There is a parking spot in front of the house as well to be shared with the current roommates. Room is unfurnished, but the roommate moving out is interested in selling her furniture. Please message me if you are interested or know anyone who would be.  \nAbout us: I’m 27 and currently working for Lucasfilm Animation in lighting/fx and am the proud owner of a Corgi named Indie (ana Jones). I’m a graduate from Ringling College of Art and Design with a major in Computer Animation.   The other roommate is a 23 year old young professional working in finance. He is gone most of the time for work and spends most of his time in his room.  Please contact me if you're interested or know anyone who might be interested! Thanks, Alex",

    "post": "TLDR: $1,286 room in lower haight available Nov 1 in 6bed2ba huge home\nWe’re 5 chill and responsible people (2 women 3 men, ages 28 to 39) looking for a 6th in our Haight Street apartment, 2 blocks off Duboce Park. We love our home and all get along and hang out together while also respecting individual space and time. There are 2 large common areas, large kitchen, 2 bathrooms, washer/dryer. The room in question has street facing windows, a lofted bed, and closet (see pictures). Move in preferred on November 1st with some flexibility. Long term (>12 months) roommate preferred. Landlord sadly doesn’t allow pets (except in the case of service animals per CA law). \nAbout Us: \nW (he,him - 39): Nerdy and cheesy psycholinguist with a love of the ocean whose favorite place to dance is the kitchen.\nK (he,him - 35): Lover of movies and good conversation, dreamscape creator and musical facilitator, often out making magic for folks in the city and up and down the coast, with an infectious laugh. \nL (she, her - 33): Fried-food-lover and roller skater, equally likely to be found in front of Real Housewives or the DSM-5, who missed her calling as a personal stylist or interior designer.\nB (she,her - 30): Get-it-done nurse who splits her time between SF and NY when not hopping over to Sweden for Beyoncé concerts.\nE (he,him - 28): Explorer of restaurants and bars who loves finding a new SF staircase or alleyway and is silly to his core.\nNow tell us about you! Please give us some census-style info (name, age, etc…) as well as your one-line intro, and answer the following questions (short answers please):\nWhy do you want to live with us?\nWhat does a typical day look like for you?\nWhen is the soonest that you are available to meet us? \nWe are hoping to do interviews a.s.a.p. Looking forward to meeting you!",

I am looking for two roommates for a just newly renovated, rent controlled, iconic apartment in Nob Hill/Russian Hill area right on Polk Street!\nAddress: 2355 Polk St\n(99/100 walking score)\nRent: $2150 for the 322 sqft room, and $2050 for the 306 sqft room.\nI have toured the place personally, and these rooms are truly gigantic! They are living-room sized rooms where you can fit a bed, a sofa, a desk, and probably most things you can think of. The house is very modern and just newly renovated, and it is one of the most iconic buildings in the neighborhood. In unit washer and dryer. The apartment is right across from Crunch fitness, and Polk Street is full of bars, cafes, and amazing restaurants - it's a truly lively vibe!\n-Ghirardelli Square and the waterfront is also only a few minutes away.\n-Walking distance from Trader Joe's and Whole Foods.\nFeel free to DM me for additional details or if you want to stop by and check out the place!",

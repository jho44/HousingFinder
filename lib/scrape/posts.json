I'm hoping somebody can take over by the end of September. \nOkay, just to get this out of the way: you're not allowed to cook in  this apartment. I know, it's inconvenient. I'll leave my microwave and blender behind if you want it. I didn't build the place. Nonetheless, there are quite a few upsides to this place that I think are perfect for someone looking to make a living on their own. It comes with a free washer and dryer, free wifi router, a nice bathroom, plenty of closet space, efficient heating/AC, and it's a half-mile walk from the Balboa Park BART station. You can't really find a better deal for your own place for this cheap in San Francisco. It's no mcmansion, but you know the saying: country boys make do. \nTLDR: Pros - cheap studio in SF with most the amenities you'd want. Cons - no cooking.\nThis property is owned by GBA Realty, not me. If you'd like to take a  tour, let me know and I'd be happy to let you check it out. You'll sign a one-year lease once I give my landlord the OK. You can move in as soon as October 1st. Let me know if you need any other info. Thanks!",

I am from the bay area, I'm 28, graduated from Arizona State, and I work in sales in the beverage industry. I have a hybrid work schedule. I work from home a couple days of the week, and I'll be out in the field the other days. I will need a place where there is covered parking or parking available for my car as I do use it for work, willing to pay extra. \nIn my free time I love to watch sports, go to the gym and exercise, have a couple drinks on the weekends or get a round of golf in. Appreciate any kind of help or assistance on this! Thank you!",

I'm looking for a roommate to apartment search together! \n• Price range: $1500-$2500 per person\n• Neighborhood: Potrero, Bernal Heights, Haight (panhandle), Glen Park (open to Cole Valley and Western Addition as well)\n• Move in date: Oct 1 to mid Nov (fairly flexible)\n• Amenities: Parking, laundry, dishwasher, and potentially some garden or patio space\nAbout me:\n32M transplant from the Midwest who came to the Bay area for grad school and stayed (the past 7 years) for work and the outdoor adventures. I work in the design district as a medical device engineer. I love staying active so you can often find me surfing, mountain biking, climbing, backpacking, skiing and anything else that gets me outside.  (This comes with a fair bit of gear so I'll need to find a place with reasonable storage.) I also love to cook, try new restaurants/bars, and travel.\nI'm moving up from Redwood City to be closer to work and friends. \nI'm hoping to live with someone who's also active so we could have some adventures together. Relaxed, social, and clean would also be great attributes. Bonus points if you love to cook.\nMessage me if you think we'd be a good fit!",

The vibes We are kind, chill, creative, crafty, and a bit Burner-y. It’s a diverse group: majority femme and majority LGBTQ, in our mid-20s to mid-40s, hailing from 3 countries and a multitude of backgrounds. As a community we're more organic than \"intentional\", but we're all very close, supportive of each other, and spend quality time together. We’re looking for a housemate who is warm, kind, thoughtful, creative, and easy to live with.\nLife at NuHaus\nWe love organic interaction, and generally avoid scheduled house events. Instead you might find us cooking together, walking to the park together, cuddled up on the couch watching something, coworking at our dining table, or heading as a group to our favorite festivals. About once a year we throw an over-the-top theme party packed with immersive art; in the lead-up to that the house will be buzzing with creative activity, and our 3D printer will be running non-stop.\nWe’re an introvert-friendly community. Some nights we’re up together into the wee hours of the morning, lying together on someone’s bed, just talking and chilling. Other nights, the house is quiet as we hole up in our rooms working on our projects. We love spending time with each other, but we also respect the days when we need quiet time.\n**Common interests**: Hanging out together.\n**Utilities and other costs**: PG&E bill split equally\n**Pet policy**: No pets allowed.\n**Details about logistics and neighborhood**:Located on McAllister Street between Alamo Square and the Panhandle, our neighborhood has everything:\n- Great brunch spots that the Marina bros haven’t discovered yet.\n- A chef/rapper who makes the best Chinese food next door.\n- An organic market where the owner doesn’t judge you for buying a load of vegetables one day and a 6-person supply of chocolate for one person the next (#NewYearNewMe). Thanks Hani!\n**Parking situation details**: Street parking only.\n**Other details**: Your room, should you choose to accept it\nThe open room is the smallest room on the lower floor. It has a window, but it doesn’t get a ton of natural light. The rent is $1,150 per month, plus utilities (usually around $100/month). It has a nice wooden loft built for the space by the current resident, which you can snag from them at an affordable price (it makes the space feel much bigger!).\nPractical Home Details\n- Street parking only\n- 1.5 baths per floor over two floors (so 2 full baths and 2 half-baths total)\n- Full kitchen and lounge area on each floor\n- Washer and dryer on each floor\n- Fancy electric bidet toilet on each floor \n- Move-in cost is 1 month’s rent plus 1.5 months’ security deposit\n- No pets, sorry!\nWe don’t have strict COVID rules anymore (thankfully), but we still keep space for open and empathetic conversations on the topic as the world continues to evolve. We’re all vaxxed; you should be too.\n#reposted",

Stryker is also a 13-year-old chihuahua. He needs a gentle introduction with other pets, but I'm confident they could get along. They do have accidents due to their age, however, we're on top of cleaning them up promptly and taking them outside frequently to prevent messes.\n-\nWe both work in Richmond (overnight shift), so ideally, the closer to Richmond the better. We are about to lose our housing by the end of the month. The budget is flexible. As long as the room can fit a queen mattress and a couple of dog beds, we're good. We can't afford much of a security deposit right now, but I'm more than happy to negotiate a payment plan, or services in exchange for a deposit. I used to clean houses professionally, we're both visual and digital artists artists, and I can help with data work, personal assistant work, etc. We're just needing any kind of saving grace/help to avoid a shelter and/or sleeping on the street.\nIf anyone has any leads, please let us know.",

We have a balcony overlooking Chrissy Field and it’s about a 5 min walk down to the water! There’s a rock gym down the hill (Movement) and sea lions at the pier. The rent is around $1600 a month including utilities (which won’t be charged for the first 3 months).

There is a parking spot in front of the house as well to be shared with the current roommates. Room is unfurnished.

    "post": "Hi my name is Esi! I have 2 rooms available for move in October 1st in our 4bd/1ba apartment located in the Dogpatch, SF Area. Rooms are both $1163.\nBedroom / House: Each bedroom has plenty of shelf, closet, storage space and gets a ton natural light.  One of the rooms may have furniture for purchase if interested. We have super spacious deck where we eat, hang out, and oversee our lovely neighborhood. Our utilities never exceed $100.\nLocation: Our apartment is located one block away from the T, cal train and various muni bus lines. We are walking distance from Potrero Hill, Mission Bay, tons of restaurants, coffee shops, liquor & grocery store and parks! Perfect for folks who don’t have cars or rely on public transportation.\nParking is fairly easy. If you have a car the best option would to get a permit, otherwise you’ll have to move your car every few hours.\nYou are open-minded, creative and LGBTQ+ friendly, and are okay with noise as our neighborhood can be very lively at night. Ideally female only please, message me if you think you’d make a great fit! We will meet through zoom first and see where it goes from there. Move in date 10/1. Thanks!",

The home has an in-unit washer/dryer and dishwasher. There's street parking. If you don't have a car, the community is located on the water so it's just a 16-minute walk to the Main Street Alameda Ferry building which will take you to downtown SF & South SF. If you prefer BART, there's a free shuttle right outside the community that drops off at the BART station. Great location - Target, Safeway, and restaurants (Alameda Shopping Mall) are across the street. The community's scenic waterfront promenade has a picnic area, a public dock, and paths along the estuary are steps away!\nAbout me:\n I graduated from UC San Diego in 2022, and decided to move back to the Bay Area to stay closer to family - definitely don’t regret leaving that San Diego weather *sarcasm*\n I’m currently working at SFO (airport)\n In my free time, I enjoy exploring the city, going out with friends, burning my money on nearby yummy food places, and then working out to justify it\n I’m looking for a roommate who’s either a working professional or a student that is clean, respectful, and sociable\nYour rent would be $1700/mo + half of utilities. It is a 12-month lease. Please direct message me if you’re interested!",

You will be sharing the place with two other roommates.\nRent: $1,600 plus utilities (approximately $70-$100) and a $34 monthly cleaning fee.\nDeposit: $1,600\nNo couples or pets (non-negotiable)\nMove-in date: November 1st\nRoom\nHuge master bedroom with bay windows and a private attached bathroom. The room receives ample natural light and can come furnished with a queen bed frame, a bookshelf, and a desk. The room also features two large mirrored sliding-door closets in the hallway leading to the bathroom.\nApartment\nWe have a generously sized kitchen with a dishwasher (yay!), a good-sized fridge with an ice/water dispenser, and a variety of cooking gadgets such as an Instant Pot, juicer, and more.\nThe living room is both huge and cozy, receiving lots of natural light during the day. We also have a spacious dining table where you're welcome to engage in arts and crafts, puzzles, or any other activities you enjoy. While the apartment is already furnished, we can always discuss new additions you may bring.\nThe basement houses a washer and dryer, and there's an intercom system and an electrical closet with a package code for your convenience.\nBuilding\nOur building has three units and is located on Potrero Ave, close to SF General Hospital and 24th Street. The bus stop is just a few steps away (48, 9, 9r), and the 24th St Bart Station is about a 15-minute walk. There are numerous restaurants, bars, and grocery stores in the area.\nHouse Interaction\nWe both cherish our home and maintain a clean environment. We are effective communicators and highly respectful of shared spaces and privacy. Occasionally, we watch something together or share a meal/snack, but we also understand the desire for personal time in the living room.\nWe are generally laid-back and open-minded, but please note that if you frequently have guests over or are a hard partygoer, this may not be the right fit.\nRoomates \nA 35-year-old researcher who spends the majority of his time indulging in outdoor climbing adventures.

Respect and effective communication are essential, as we are looking for someone who values a home rather than just a place to sleep. Please refrain from leaving dishes in the sink for extended periods.\nWhile we enjoy socializing, we prefer to keep parties outside the house (occasional dinner parties are welcomed and encouraged!).\nIf this sounds like the ideal place for you, please reach out and tell us about yourself, and feel free to share your social media profiles. We look forward to meeting our future roommate!",

    "post": "(Nov move in) PRESIDIO ROOM AVAILABLE FOR NOVEMBER MOVE IN\nHello all!\nWe have a room to be filled in our lovely Presidio House. We have a balcony overlooking Chrissy Field and it’s about a 5 min walk down to the water! There’s a rock gym down the hill (Movement) and sea lions at the pier. The rent is around $1600 a month including utilities (which won’t be charged for the first 3 months). We will be renegotiating the lease in November with the new roommate, but we don’t anticipate the rent increasing too much. It’s a 3 bedroom apartment, with 1 full bathroom and 1 half bathroom downstairs. Washer and dryer included, wifi, and a fully furnished living room. There is a parking spot in front of the house as well to be shared with the current roommates. Room is unfurnished. Please message me if you are interested or know anyone who would be.\nAbout us: I’m 27 and currently working for Lucasfilm Animation in lighting/fx and am the proud owner of a Corgi named Indie (ana Jones). I’m a graduate from Ringling College of Art and Design with a major in Computer Animation.\nThe other roommate is a 23 year old young professional working in finance. He is gone most of the time for work and spends most of his time in his room.\nPlease contact me if you're interested or know anyone who might be interested!\nThanks,\nAlex(",

The bathroom will be shared with one other roommate. The room is toward the back of the house and has a view of the private backyard. You can comfortably fit a queen bed, multiple dressers, and have room to work out in. The mirrored and wooden closet come with the room. You have access to a large backyard, and you can paint your room if you like! No pets, sorry!\nThe house sits in a very quiet and safe neighborhood in Sunnyside/Glen Park, and street parking has never been an issue. There is also a parking spot available in the driveway. It is a short 8-ish minute walk down the hill to Glen Park BART station, and there's a cute downtown area with good restaurants and the Glen Canyon Market (really nice produce and deli). There is in-unit washer/dryer. The kitchen is huge, with a microwave, dishwasher, oven, and tons of storage space.\nWe are looking for single occupancy, so please, no couples, though friends and overnight guests are welcome within limits.\nShort-term lease is available, but looking for folks who would stay for longer!\nThe roommates are both quiet, and courteous, who keep the space clean and value those who will do the same. Anyone of all backgrounds is welcome!\nA bit about the roommates:\nV (he/him) is a software engineer in his mid-twenties and works from home 1-2 days a week. He's introverted, though often enjoys hiking, walking, or a good board game. He likes to keep things clean and organized. You'd be sharing the bathroom with him.\nF (they/she) is a 30 year old queer latiné who works as a project manager for an art non profit in the Bay Area. They are a ceramist, plant lover, and movie nerd. They generally work from home, so you will probably be seeing them in the day, but is generally at the ceramic studio most afternoons/evenings.\nPlease send us a short bio about yourself and any questions that you have and we'll get back to you as soon as we can to set up a tour. Thanks!",
